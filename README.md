Irina Temnikova, Carlos Castillo, Sarah Vieweg: [The Case for Readability of Crisis Communications in Social Media](http://chato.cl/papers/temnikova_vieweg_castillo_2015_readability_crisis_tweets_disaster_social_media.pdf). In Social Web for Diaster Management (SWDM), 18-22 May 2015. Florence, Italy.

This data was annotated by crowdsourcing workers from platform Crowdflower.

## Files

* The `instructions.txt` file includes the instructions shown to annotators.
* The `labels.csv` file includes the text of the tweet and the assessment from the annotators.

*Note 1*: some tweets appear twice in the file (even with different labels), as the tweets were also used as test questions. Both labelings of the same tweet are independent.

*Note 2*: unfortunately, tweet-ids were converted to 32-bit integer and hence truncated 3 or 4 decimal places.
